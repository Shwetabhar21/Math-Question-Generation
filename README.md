# Math-Question-Generation
Two original quantitative math problems on combinations and geometry, featuring real-world scenarios, image notes, and detailed curriculum mapping.

## üìÑ Overview

This repository contains my solution for the **Math Question Generation** assignment.
The task was to create **two original math questions** based on the given base problems, ensuring they:

* Preserve the **type of mathematical skill** tested (e.g., combinations, geometric measurement).
* Are written in the **exact format** specified in the assignment (`@title`, `@description`, `@question`, etc.).
* Use **subject ‚Üí unit ‚Üí topic** strictly from the provided curriculum.
* Include **image descriptions** where required.

 ##üìùInformation

**@title** Ice Cream & Packaging Math Challenge
**@description**
This assessment evaluates problem-solving skills in quantitative mathematics through real-world scenarios.
It includes:

* A combinatorics problem involving counting possible combinations of items.
* A geometry and measurement problem estimating the dimensions of a package.
  Both questions are aligned with the Quantitative Math curriculum and require logical reasoning, basic arithmetic, and interpretation of tabular and spatial information.

## üìù New Questions Created

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ice Cream Cone Combinations

* **Skill Tested:** Counting combinations.
* **Scenario:** Pairing ice cream cone types with flavors to find the total unique combinations possible.
* **Image Note:** Table showing cone types in one column and ice cream flavors in another, styled like the original assignment example.
* **Curriculum Mapping:**

  * Subject: Quantitative Math
  * Unit: Problem Solving
  * Topic: Numbers and Operations

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensions of a Box Holding Books

* **Skill Tested:** Estimating box dimensions using object arrangement.
* **Scenario:** Finding the dimensions of a rectangular box packed with books in rows.
* **Image Note:** Top view diagram showing 2 rows of 5 rectangles side-by-side inside a bigger rectangle.
* **Curriculum Mapping:**

  * Subject: Quantitative Math
  * Unit: Geometry and Measurement
  * Topic: Area & Volume

## üìÇ File Contents

* **math\_question\_generation\_new\.docx** ‚Üí Contains the two new questions, formatted according to assignment specifications with headings, options, explanations, curriculum mapping, and image notes.

## üì∏ Image Notes

* **Question 1:** Table of cone types and flavors for visual clarity.
